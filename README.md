With over 5 years of experience in full-stack development and systems programming, I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from small startups to corporate applications. My expertise spans building scalable web applications and developing tools for system automation and data collection.

I specialize in both application development and system-level programming, combining a solid understanding of software engineering with low-level system knowledge. And I like tea more than coffee.
