# 👋 Hello! I'm Seeker

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer and crypto enthusiast who enjoys building innovative and user-friendly applications. With a focus on full-stack and systems development, I strive to create solutions that make a difference. Also, I like cats.

## 🧑‍💼 Experience

I've been working on passion projects since I was like 11, so it's been a while for sure. I wouldn't count that time period as 'experience' necessarily though, as it's not something I'd like to be shown on my portfolio. As such, I began taking coding very seriously from 2023 onwards, as a potential means of livelihood and as a passion of mine (I may be masochistic xD), and have worked on multiple projects applicable to the real world these past 2 or so years, and have worked with several companies (including LunarProxy and twine2, a dating app startup) to work on my experience and professionalism. In summary, I got you.
